# Project Title

Welcome to the project! This repository contains all the necessary code and instructions to get you started with our demo.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Docker Desktop: [Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

## Setting Up a Sandbox Environment

If you prefer to use a sandbox environment for Docker and Kubernetes, you can utilize the following online platforms:

- Play with Docker: [labs.play-with-docker.com](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/)
- Play with Kubernetes: [labs.play-with-k8s.com](https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/)

## Getting Started with the Demo

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **Build and Run with Docker:**

    ```bash
    docker build -t your-image-name .
    docker run -p 8080:8080 your-image-name
    ```

3. **Deploy with Kubernetes:**

    Create a Kubernetes deployment file (e.g., `deployment.yaml`) with the following content:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: your-app
    spec:
      replicas: 2
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: your-app
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: your-app
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: your-app
            image: your-image-name
            ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
    ```

    Apply the deployment:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
    ```

4. **Access the Application:**

    - For Docker: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`
    - For Kubernetes: Get the service URL using `kubectl` and access it via your browser.
