Docker and Multi-Stage Builds Guide
Traditional Builds vs. Multi-Stage Builds in Docker
In a traditional Docker build, all steps are executed in a single sequence within one build container. This includes tasks like downloading dependencies, compiling code, and packaging the application. As a result, every layer created during this process ends up in the final image. While this method works, it often leads to large images that contain unnecessary components, increasing both the size and security risks of the image. This is where multi-stage builds become beneficial.

What Are Multi-Stage Builds?
Multi-stage builds allow you to define multiple stages in your Dockerfile, each dedicated to a specific task. It's like running different parts of the build process in separate environments. By isolating the build environment from the final runtime environment, you can greatly reduce the size of the final image and minimize potential security vulnerabilities. This approach is particularly useful for applications with extensive build dependencies.
